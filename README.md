# emoji-react ðŸ˜€
Dead simple react component for rendering emojis.

Tired of copying literal emoji characters into your code? Characters don't look right in your editor? This component makes it a little easier.

## Installation
NPM: `npm install emoji-react`

## Usage
```js
import Emoji from 'emoji-react';

// ...

ReactDOM.render(<Emoji name="smiling face with smiling eyes" />, rootNode)
```

The names of emojis are taken from the unicode spec, [here](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html).

That's it! Have fun, and be ðŸ˜Š.

### This is stupid, can't I just use unicode characters in my code?
Yep! âœŒ
